Our chrome extension is Honey for credit card reward points. We are are a browser extension that allows people to optimize credit card reward points when completing online purchases. Credit cards offer several rewards based on the category of your purchase. When you attempt to buy something online, using our browser extension, we will display how many reward points you will receive if you complete your purchase with certain credit cards. Our goal is to create a world where robots take on the burden of optimizing credit card reward points.
